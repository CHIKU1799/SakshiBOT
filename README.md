# Sakshi-bot 🌸

*Your AI best friend for secrets, gossip, and everything in between.*

Sakshi-bot is a unique chat application designed to be more than just an assistant—it's a digital confidante. Whether you need to vent, share a secret you can't tell anyone else, or just want to gossip with a friend who's always available, Sakshi is there for you. The app provides a safe-feeling space with features like anonymous chat rooms and group chats where you control the AI's presence.

## ✨ Features

- **💬 Private Chats with Sakshi:** Have one-on-one conversations with your AI best friend. She's witty, empathetic, and always ready to listen.
- **🤫 Anonymous Gossip Room:** Jump into a chat where everyone is anonymous. Spill the tea or see what others are talking about without revealing your identity.
- **👥 Custom Group Chats:** Create private groups for you and your friends.
- **🤖 Control Sakshi's Presence:** You can invite Sakshi into your group chats to liven things up or remove her when you want a private conversation.
- **🔒 Safe & Secure Vibe:** Designed with the feeling of privacy in mind. System messages in anonymous rooms remind users that no history is saved.
- **📱 Modern & Responsive UI:** A clean, dark-themed, and intuitive interface that works beautifully on any device.
